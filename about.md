Hi. I'm Juan Fernandez Arias. I am an electronics engineer in Munich (Germany).

I have studied in Madrid (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid) and in Munich (Technische Universität München) where I got the double degree.

I have spent most of my professioal career in the field of medical devices. I have experience in the hardware design of medical products, from the requirements phase, the implementation and debug to the certifications phase:

- Requirements Specification
- Architecture and Detail Design
- Schematics Design 
- PCB Layout (DFM and DFT)
- PCBAs bring-up and testing
- Electrical Safety 
- ...

I am also an IPC [Certified Interconnect Designer (CID)](https://www.ipc.org/ipc-designer-certification-program)

Additionally I have some experience in the software development, as part of the embedded HW/SW Design. I have coded and debug microcontrollers in C/C++. I also got some experience with Labview and National Instruments Hardware (FPGA Boards). Both in the medical field as well.

But most of my Software Skills come from my hobby time. I like to read and play with new and old technologies, I spend some of my free time with this kind of projects:

- Programming Websites with [Jekyllrb :)](http://jekyllrb.com/) or Hugo
- Trying to make my home smart with Homeassistant
- Playing with Raspberry Pi
- Automating Boring Stuff with Python
- Analyzing Data with Python (Excel is old stuff)
- Creating my sensors with Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32 and similar
- Repairing and Sanitizing Laptops for [Labdoo](https://www.labdoo.org/)
- Defending Linux for Home Users as well (Stop using windows...)
- ...and much more things

This website is an attempt to document my work and serve as a portfolio, but at the same time being a logbook for me of things I did and I don't want to forget.

The rest of the day I like to play football and (as you can see in the picture) ride my bikes.
