## About Me

## About Me

Hi! I'm Juan Fernandez Arias, an electronics engineer based in Munich, Germany.

I hold a double degree in Industrial Engineering (Electronics and Control Theory) from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and the Technische Universität München. Since 2013, I’ve been developing cutting-edge medical devices, with a strong focus on hardware design — from requirements engineering through to certification and production. My experience includes:

- Requirements specification and hardware architecture  
- Schematic and PCB design (with DFM/DFT in mind)  
- PCB bring-up and testing  
- Coordination across hardware, software, and mechanical teams  
- Electrical and functional safety certification  
- IPC Certified Interconnect Designer ([CID](https://www.ipc.org/ipc-designer-certification-program))

Though primarily a hardware engineer, I’ve worked extensively on embedded systems, writing and debugging firmware in C/C++.

In my free time, I dive into side projects blending hardware and software. I enjoy:

- Building websites with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or Hugo  
- Automating tasks with Python  
- Creating smart home setups with Home Assistant and Raspberry Pi  
- Developing IoT projects with Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32  
- Contributing to [Labdoo](https://www.labdoo.org/) by repairing and sanitizing donated laptops  
- Advocating for Linux as a viable OS for everyday users  
- Playing with cutting-edge AI tools  
- Building and maintaining my own homelab

Recently, I’ve developed a growing passion for personal finance and investing. I enjoy analyzing data, backtesting ideas, and exploring how technology can help democratize access to financial tools. This website is part portfolio, part personal lab — a place where I document what I build, learn, and discover along the way.

I’m fluent in Spanish, English, and German, and speak conversational Italian.

When I’m not tinkering or coding, you’ll probably find me playing football or cycling around the Bavarian countryside.
