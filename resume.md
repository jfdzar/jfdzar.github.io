## 2018 - Today
### Livanova Deutschland GmbH

Working in Livanova since 2018. To be completed...

## 2013 - 2018
### Hepa Wash GmbH (Now Advitos GmbH)

Hepa Wash is committed to the development of an extra-corporeal support therapy for the treatment of patients with life threatening liver and kidney failure. Hepa Wash develops, produces and commercializes a dialysis device and all the necessary accessories.

During my work in Hepa Wash I was working in the Electronics and Software R&D Deparment:

- Developing and implementing electronic solutions to increase the funcionality of the dialysis
- Support in the design of software routines
- Test and development under the 60601-1 Medical Electrical Equipment
- Guidance for bachellor and master students during their internship or thesis

I also was able to support in other departments of the company like technical field service, logistics, production, etc.

Some of the milestones I was involved were:

- Improving the Product Development Process of the company
- Creating a process to draw cables with Altium Designer
- Support the migration from Eagle to Altium Designer
- Develop the documentation (BOM and Output Files) to scale the PCB Production to an external EDA Service Provider
- Achieve the certification according the 3rd edition of the 60601-1
- Implementing a Data Analysis System of the Data from the field with Python

### Masther Thesis Hepa Wash GmbH (Now Advitos GmbH)
The main purpose of the thesis was to develop an automatic test platform to test the printed circuit board of the liver dialysis machine of Hepa Wash.

The goal was to increase the quality of the product detecting failures before mounting the boards on the machine and also save production time.

At the end of the thesis the prototype was fully functional and it could be implemented in the company processes.

I got a great overview in designing and documenting hardware and software for medical products.

## 2011 - 2013
### (TUM) Master Maschinenwessen: Elektronik und Informatik und Regelungstechnik
I had the chance to make a double degree programm in the TUM. This was a great oportunity as I could see how other educational system work.

I focus on exploring different areas and not just focus on electronics. I took courses on Aerodynamics, Control Therory, Computational Intelligece (great one) and also some workshop on Image Recognition.

At the end I discover the medical field. I could write one of the semestersarbeit in Medtech Department. Main topic was designing a website which could automatically analize images and show the results like amount and size of cells. It was really interesting but I wanted to go back to the electronics so I wrote my Master Thesis in a Company called Hepa Wash (see above)

### HiWi Student
Evaluation of DC and brush-less motors for mini quadrocopters.

I developed a Matlab program to acquire power and force data with a DAQ from different motors. Additionally I developed a PCBs to better interface the motors with the DAQ. At the end I executed several test on different motors and propellers and evaluated the data

## 2007 - 2011
### (UPM) Ingenerio Superior Industrial: Automatica y Electronica
In the UPM in Madrid I got the basic principles of engineering (Maths, Phisics, etc). In my third and fourth year of studies is where I got to know the electronic world and got fascinated by digital electronics.

At that point the Arduino Scene was starting. It was crazy how fast it grew...I am sure our practical courses look know totally different to back then.

### Induforum 2011
Job Fair created and managed by university students. We divided ourselves in different departments.

I was part of the IT department, mainly developing and mantaining our website. From a very basic static webpage we managed to migrate it to a Wordpress to allow better user interaction and more services for the sponsors and students.

Additionally we were supporting other departments serving the webmails and supporting other processes.
