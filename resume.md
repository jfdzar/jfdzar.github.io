## 2018 – Today  
### Livanova Deutschland GmbH  
**Senior Hardware Engineer – Munich, Germany**

LivaNova is a global medical technology company focused on transforming lives with products and therapies for the head and heart. The Munich site specializes in cardiopulmonary and heart surgery solutions.

At LivaNova, I am responsible for the electrical hardware design and development of medical products within the Cardiac Surgery Franchise, covering the full lifecycle from concept to serial production:

- Development following the V-Model, including requirements engineering using Polarion  
- Hardware architecture and detailed design documentation  
- Circuit, PCB, and cable design using Altium Designer  
  - Led the migration to Altium Designer, including library migration, guidelines setup, and workflow definition  
  - Developed a system for cable drawings within Altium  
- PCB design according to DFM and DFT for flying probe testing  
- PCB bring-up, testing, and validation  
- IPC Certified Interconnect Designer ([CID](https://www.ipc.org/ipc-designer-certification-program))  
- Technical lead coordinating cross-functional integration (hardware, software, mechanical)  
- Main contact for electrical and functional safety certifications  
- Automation of repetitive engineering tasks using Python

## 2013 – 2018  
### Hepa Wash GmbH (Now Advitos GmbH)  
**R&D Engineer – Software and Electronics**

Hepa Wash developed extracorporeal therapy systems for patients with life-threatening liver and kidney failure. My work in the R&D department spanned electronics and embedded software development:

- Designed and implemented electronic subsystems to enhance dialysis device functionality  
- Supported software development for embedded control  
- Conducted testing and design under IEC 60601-1 standards  
- Mentored bachelor’s and master’s students during internships and thesis projects  

I also contributed to other areas such as technical field service, logistics, and production.

**Key achievements:**

- Improved internal Product Development Processes  
- Developed a standardized process for cable design in Altium Designer  
- Supported migration from Eagle to Altium  
- Defined documentation flows (BOMs, output files) to enable external PCB manufacturing  
- Contributed to 3rd edition IEC 60601-1 certification  
- Built a Python-based system for field data analysis

### Master’s Thesis – Hepa Wash GmbH

**Project:** Development of an automated PCB test platform for the liver dialysis machine.

- Objective: Improve product quality and reduce production time by detecting hardware issues prior to assembly  
- Outcome: Delivered a functional prototype ready for integration into production  
- Gained hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and documenting hardware/software for medical devices

## 2011 – 2013  
### Technische Universität München (TUM)  
**M.Sc. Maschinenwesen – Electronics, Informatics, and Control Engineering**

As part of a double degree program, I expanded my academic foundation by exploring diverse subjects including:

- Aerodynamics  
- Control Theory  
- Computational Intelligence (a favorite)  
- Image Recognition workshops  

My academic journey into medtech began with a semester project in the Medical Engineering department, where I developed a web application to analyze and quantify biological images. While fascinating, my passion remained in electronics, which I pursued through my thesis at Hepa Wash.

### HiWi Student Research Assistant – TUM  

**Project:** Evaluation of DC and brushless motors for mini quadcopters

- Built a Matlab interface for DAQ-based measurement of motor power and thrust  
- Designed custom PCBs to interface motors with the DAQ  
- Conducted performance tests across different motors and propellers

## 2007 – 2011  
### Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)  
**B.Sc. + M.Eng. in Industrial Engineering – Automation and Electronics**

Here I built my foundation in core engineering subjects (math, physics, etc.). In my later years, I discovered a passion for electronics — especially digital electronics.

This was during the rise of Arduino, and I was immediately captivated by the DIY potential of embedded systems.
