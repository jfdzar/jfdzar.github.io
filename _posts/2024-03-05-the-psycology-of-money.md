Reading *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel has been a transformative experience—not just in how I think about money, but in how I perceive luck, effort, expectations, and what really matters.

## 🎲 Luck, Risk, and Humility

> “Bill Gates experienced one in a million luck by ending up at Lakeside. Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk by never getting to finish what he and Gates set out to achieve.”

We often attribute success to talent or hard work, but sometimes, it’s just timing. Recognizing this helps me stay grounded and less judgmental—towards others and myself.

> “When you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that financial success—both your own and others’—is never as good or as bad as it seems.”

## ⚖️ Don't Risk What You Need

> “There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.”

As someone who loves tweaking and optimizing, this really hit home. In projects, pushing boundaries is fun. In personal finances, not always wise.

## 🧠 Sunk Costs and Letting Go

> “Sunk costs... make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves.”

This resonated with the engineer in me—how many times have I kept going with a side project just because of the hours I already put in? Time to let go when things no longer serve a purpose.

## 💰 Real Wealth Is Invisible

> “Savings can be created by spending less. You will desire less if you care less about what others think of you.”

Real wealth isn’t flashy. It’s freedom. The less I try to impress, the more energy I have for what truly matters—tinkering, building, and learning.

## 📉 Inequality, Expectations, and Reality

> “Between 1993 and 2012, the top 1% saw their incomes grow 86.1%, while the bottom 99% saw just 6.6% growth.”

> “Everything in finance is data within the context of expectations.”

The world has shifted. Expectations haven’t. Understanding this gives perspective—it’s not just about individual choices, but the system we live in.

## 🌱 Reasonable Optimism

> “Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks.”

Engineering taught me to design for failure but build for success. Housel’s optimism is the same—pragmatic, grounded, and forward-looking.

### Final Thoughts

*The Psychology of Money* is more about how we think than what we know. It changed how I look at work, effort, and value. If you're into engineering, systems, or simply making smarter life choices—this one is a must-read.
