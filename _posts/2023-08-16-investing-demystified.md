After reading *Investing Demystified: How to Invest Without Speculation and Sleepless Nights*, I wanted to summarize the most impactful lessons I’ve found worth applying. This isn’t a how-to on picking the next Tesla, but rather a framework to think clearly about wealth and risk.

## 🧱 Step 1: Inventory Your Life – Assets, Intangibles, Liabilities

The book emphasizes building a **complete picture of your financial world**—not just your stock portfolio. That means considering:

**Tangible Assets:**
- Investments, pensions, real estate, company stock/options, etc.
- Even things like your car and inheritance expectations

**Intangible Assets:**
- Your education, job prospects, your partner’s earning potential
- Languages, flexibility to move geographically
- If you work in finance, be careful not to double up your exposure by also investing heavily in financial markets

**Liabilities:**
- Fixed (mortgage, credit cards, loans) and flexible (taxes, future school fees)
- Ask: *Do my liabilities increase or decrease with economic downturns?* Ideally, they decrease when times are bad.

This full-life assessment really forced me to think beyond spreadsheets and ETFs. A good reminder: not all wealth is on a balance sheet.

## 📜 Step 2: Define Your Portfolio Mission Statement

This was a new one for me, and surprisingly powerful.

> Write a one-pager about your financial goals and how you expect to react to downturns.

No soaring eagles or motivational posters required.

Just answer:
- Why am I investing?
- What mix of equities/bonds matches my timeline?
- How do I *expect* to feel when markets drop 30%?

I liked the idea of *having this document ready before panic hits*. It gives you an emotional anchor in volatile times.

## 🧪 Step 3: Choosing the Right ETF – Ask the Boring Questions

Kroijer drills into the criteria to pick an ETF—and it’s surprisingly easy to get this wrong if you’re not paying attention:

- Does it track the **right index**?
- Is the **TER < 0.3%**?
- **Liquidity**: Tight spreads and high volume
- Is it **tax efficient** in *your* country?
- Is the **tracking error** small?
- Can you buy/sell it easily and cheaply?

Small things like jurisdiction and currency can make a big difference. Don't just grab the first "World ETF" you see.

## 🇩🇰 A Personal Reflection Tool

One quote really hit home:

> “I am a Danish citizen living in the UK with taxable income of X…”

Kroijer shows how putting your actual life into a template can help frame the right questions. Try adapting that sentence to your own situation and see what blind spots emerge.

## 🛡️ Bonus: Safer Than Cash?

Another gem: If you're uneasy about bank failures (we’ve all seen how fast trust evaporates), consider keeping some wealth in **government bonds** or **money market funds**. These securities stay *yours*, even if your bank collapses.

## Final Thought

The book doesn't glamorize investing. It makes a case for *clarity*, *discipline*, and *humility*. You don’t need to outsmart Wall Street—you just need to avoid playing the wrong game.

Highly recommended read, especially if you want to sleep better and think longer term.
