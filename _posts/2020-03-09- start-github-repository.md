I have tune it a bit for my needs

Steps:

1. Create a Repository on Github.
2. Select Clone "Clone or download" on Github, copy the link
3. In a terminal make git clone "repo url"
4. In Visual Studio Code, sect File -> Add Folder to Workspace ->Select the newly clone repository
5. That should be all that's required.  any newly created file should be available on github after stage/commit/push.
