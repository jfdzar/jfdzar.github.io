Over the past few years, I’ve been playing with AI tools—ChatGPT, local LLMs, Python scripts, you name it. But recently, I started a course focused on using AI for everyday tasks—especially around finance, health, and nutrition—and I have to say: I’m impressed by how far these tools have come.

## The Experiment: Letting AI Audit My Insurance

One suggestion in the course was particularly interesting: upload your insurance policies and let an AI analyze them. So I gave it a try. I uploaded several of my policies—car, health, liability, and travel—and asked some pretty basic questions like *What’s covered? What’s not? What overlaps with other policies?*

To do this, I tested different platforms and found that **Perplexity Spaces** handled this task surprisingly well. I ended up creating separate Spaces for each type of policy:
- 🚗 Car Insurance
- 🏥 Health Insurance (private, provided by my employer)
- 🧳 Travel Insurance
- ⚖️ Personal Liability Insurance

## Key Insights

Most of the time, the AI confirmed what I already knew. No crazy surprises. But still, a few things stood out.

### Redundant Memberships
I discovered that my car insurance already included roadside assistance. This made my membership in an automobile club kind of pointless—so I canceled that.

### Spotting Gaps and Overlaps
With my health insurance, the AI helped me confirm that there wasn’t much more I could extract from it. It's pretty locked down—good coverage, but no hidden extras.

When it came to travel insurance, I had questions about what was covered in Europe. Was it worth renewing for a trip I was planning? The AI helped me make that decision confidently.

## Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. It was a low-effort, high-reward kind of experiment. AI didn’t just speed up the reading and comparison—it gave me a sense of confidence that I hadn’t missed anything important.

I’ll probably make this part of a yearly review moving forward. Upload the new policies, run some comparisons, and double-check if there’s anything I can optimize.

**TL;DR:** AI is finally at the point where it can make personal admin work—like reviewing insurance policies—way less painful. If you haven’t tried it, I highly recommend giving it a go.
