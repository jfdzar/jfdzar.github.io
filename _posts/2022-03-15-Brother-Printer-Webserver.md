### Printing Labdoo Tags with a Brother QL Printer

As part of the [Labdoo project](https://platform.labdoo.org/de/content/labels), I need to print and attach device tags to laptops. Initially, I was printing them on regular paper and covering them with tape â€” a frustrating and time-consuming process.

One day, I came across this [post on our Coffee Wall](https://platform.labdoo.org/de/content/labels) about printing proper labels, and it changed everything.

After a bit of research, I discovered a Python library made for Brother QL printers: [Brother QL on GitHub](https://github.com/pklaus/brother_ql). I thought: _I have to make this work!_

So, I created a Python tool that runs a small webserver using Flask to print Labdoo labels â€” and potentially much more:

For those who prefer simplicity or donâ€™t want to run a webserver, I also made a lightweight version:

The installation is well documented in the repo, so I wonâ€™t repeat it all here. But I wanted to provide some background and share how this small improvement saved me a lot of time and hassle.

Also worth noting â€” Iâ€™ve recently added Docker support to the main project to simplify setup and improve reproducibility.

Happy printing!
