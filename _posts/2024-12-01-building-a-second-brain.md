Recently, I finished reading *Building a Second Brain* by Tiago Forte, and it really struck a chord with me. Below are some of the ideas that resonated the most and how I plan to integrate them into my own systems.

## 📚 From Passive Consumption to Active Creation

> *“Shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.”*

This quote alone reframed my digital habits. Rather than endlessly reading and bookmarking content, I’m focusing more on producing: notes, blog posts, code, designs. The goal is to make knowledge *actionable*. It is difficult but I try.

## 🧠 Thinking as a Habit

> *“Being organized is a habit—a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with, and put information to use.”*

Organization isn't about the right tool. It’s about small habits—like naming files clearly, using a capture system, or revisiting your notes weekly—that keep your mind free for actual thinking.

## 🔍 PARA System in Action

The PARA system—Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives—is deceptively simple but incredibly powerful:

- **Projects**: What I’m actively working on
- **Areas**: Things I need to maintain (health, finances, etc.)
- **Resources**: Stuff I may use someday (e.g. ESP8266 notes)
- **Archives**: Completed or inactive items

I've reorganized my digital files to fit this model and it has made retrieval and focus so much easier.

## ✍️ Writing = Thinking

> *“Writing creates new knowledge that wasn’t there before.”*

I've noticed that writing even short notes triggers mental connections. That’s why I now write quick summaries and reactions even to tweets or interesting code snippets. Even I have tried to write small notes about books, films or events I attend.

## 🧪 The Power of Open Questions

Inspired by Richard Feynman’s strategy:

> *“He would test new ideas against a list of open questions.”*

I'm starting a living list of “Questions I’m always thinking about” in my notes. It includes things like:
- How can I automate more of my life?
- What are simple ways to teach technical skills?
- How can I keep my attention focused and healthy?

This helps make my learning more intentional.

## 🛠 Progressive Summarization

> *“Highlight the main points of a note, then highlight those highlights.”*

Could be a game changer but I still see it very difficult to implement. I may need to revise this note in the future and see how it is going.

## ✅ Weekly Reviews That Actually Work

My weekly checklist now includes:
- Clearing inboxes (email, notes, downloads)
- Reviewing current projects and goals
- Reprioritizing tasks
- Archiving completed work and capturing lessons learned

It’s about keeping the system light and in motion.

## 🎯 Finish Before You’re Ready

> *“Don’t just let the moment pass as if it doesn’t matter… Run after your obsessions with everything you have.”*

This quote reminded me to pay attention to what excites me—like a good book, a side project, a crazy idea—and to act on it fast. That’s when creative flow happens.

## 💡 Final Reflection

> *“We only know what we make.” – Giambattista Vico*

What I’ve realized is that organizing information is not about storage—it’s about transformation. When we actively shape what we learn, we create new ideas, new opportunities, and a new version of ourselves.
